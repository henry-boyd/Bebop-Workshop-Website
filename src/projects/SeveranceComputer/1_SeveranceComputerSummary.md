<p style="font-style: italic;"> The work is mysterious and important... </p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
    Here at Lumon Industries, we know that a worker is only as good as their tools. That's why we strive to provide our severed employees with the very latest in data refinement technology. Our top of the line computers and refiner workstations ensure our severed workforce maintains a near-constant state of divine efficiency. When they're not talking shop around the water cooler, that is!

<p style="font-style: italic;">
    At Lumon Industries you're always doing your best work, even when you don't know it.
