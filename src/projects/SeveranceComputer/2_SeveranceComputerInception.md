    Severance is one of my favorite tv shows in a very very long time for many reasons: the storytelling, the themes, the cast, and perhaps most of all the amazing worldbuilding the show has done. The costumes, office architecture, and props all do an amazing job of making this crazy world where employees are severed seem so real and lived in. And the show does a brilliant job of tying in so many different commentaries and criticisms of modern corporate culture that I resonate with a lot having worked in a few different corporate environments during my career.

    Naturally I wanted to build something revolving around the show, and the Lumon office computers seemed like the best option that would be a combination of hardware and software work. The design is timeless in that it combines a lot of elements from various decades of computing technology, the functionality is realistic but still a little goofy, and the color scheme (which is widely used throughout the show) is iconic. Besides, how hard could it be to build a computer?
