Spoiler Alert: I may have started a teeny tiny electrical fire. Whoopsy Daisy!

<p>But in my defense, the fire was really small and went out almost immediately. Plus it worked! Only for about five seconds but it worked!</p>
<br>
<p>I bought some new electrical wiring, reconnected everything based off of the schematic I'd made except the motor which I'll save for another day, and gave it a try. So the good news is that the lights came on, which means I had the correct pathways for everything. The bad news is that after a few seconds there was a crackle and a plume of smoke along with a little bit of flame that flashed out of the casing section that housed the wiring connections.</p>

<p>Luckily nothing important was damaged and I almost immediately realized my mistake as I was cleaning up the carbonized wire and destroyed wiring inside the projector. If it wasn't already obvious from reading this site, I am a goober. And in my goobery ways, I bought the completely wrong gauge of wire for the amount of electricity this projector requires, which explains why it worked but burst into flames after a few seconds since the wire didn't have enough capacity.</p>

<p><br>But I ordered the correct gauge of wire and will hopefully be reporting back soon with some working projector lights! </p>
