![Vintage Filmo Master Projector Ad](/projectimages/filmo/FilmoMasterVintageAd.jpg)
<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly, I didn't find whole lot about this projector while combing the depths of the internet. But luckily there were still a few bits & pieces of information in some of the more vintage corners of the web. For starters, Ebay listings helped me ID the specific Bell & Howell model I had. From there I located a few resources that were somewhat helpful.
<br>
<br>
First off, I found a few websites focusing on vintage film equipment that hadn't been updated in 30 years
<ul>
    <a href="http://8mm16mmfilms.com/order.htm"><li>http://8mm16mmfilms.com/order.htm</li></a>
    <a href="https://urbanskifilm.com/supplies.html"><li>https://urbanskifilm.com/supplies.html</li></a>
    <a href="https://www.paulivester.com/films/projector/bh_models.htm"><li>https://www.paulivester.com/films/projector/bh_models.htm</li></a>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Using those sites I confirmed the specific model I was working on, a Bell & Howell 57U Filmo Master 16mm Projector, and that it was released sometime in the late 1930s (nifty!). Outside of that I didn't find anything too helpful:

    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jviUl-1v3Bk"><li>A Youtube video of the same model in working condition</li></a>
    <a href="https://www.thehenryford.org/collections-and-research/digital-collections/artifact/297151#slide=gs-348222"><li>A similar Bell & Howell model that was part of the Henry Ford Museum's collection</li></a>
</ul>
<br>
After a couple hours of poking around it became pretty apparent I wouldn't be able to find anything more on this projector online. It looked like the rest was just going to left to luck and some good old-fashioned reverse engineering.
