Long ago in a distant land called Michigan, our young hero set forth to bring back life to an ancient mechanism... and then got distracted for a couple of years. Maybe more than a couple of years.

This project is simple enough to explain: I've got a broken vintage 16mm film projector, and I would like to fix it. Ideally I want to repair a few things: replace all of the electrical wiring, get the main lightbulb and secondary lightbulb working again, and make at least an honest attempt at fixing the motor so the projector can run film again properly. If all that goes well then I'll finally see what's on the reels of film that I found inside the projector's case way back when.

Do I know anything about electrical wiring or refurbishing vintage film projectors? Nope not a thing, but by golly I've at least got gumption and a bit of can do attitude! Fingers crossed I don't start any (more) electrical fires.
