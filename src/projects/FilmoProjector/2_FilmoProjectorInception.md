The tangled mass of metallic guts and faulty wiring you see before you used to look a lot like a projector. I mean it still kind of does now, but it used to look look a lot more like one when I first found this thing. I'm not sure exactly when I found this projector, it was either shortly before or shortly after moving to Michigan. I'm a sucker for any kind of garage/tag/estate sale, so when I noticed one across the street from my mother's house I had no choice but to pop in.

Wouldn't you know it, turns out the woman whose estate sale I'd stumbled into had lived a pretty extraordinary life judging by the things she had left behind. I don't have any concrete evidence but I suspect she may have been a scholar or involved in academia somehow given how close she lived to the university nearby. Plus there were all kind of antique books, travel guides, and other signs of a curious mind scattered throughout the place. I ended up bringing home a stack of books too (mostly antique travel guides for faroff places, even a few for countries that no longer existed like Ceylon and Burma along with a guide to traveling via steamship from the early 1900s).

But I digress, back to the projector. There it was, tucked away in a corner of the house's basement: a 16mm Bell & Howell Filmo S film projector, still in the original carrying case along with the manual, an oil can, a couple of spare bulbs, and some film reels. From the outside it seemed to be in immaculate condition, the exterior metal pieces still all shiny and chrome. So I was determined to get it running so I could find out what was on these film reels myself. I lugged the projector back across the street, plugged it in, and waited. It slowly whirred to life, light shining out of the front, hummed and clicked for about five seconds, and then a huge plume of smoke burst out of the motor compartment.

After the smoke cleared I gave the projector a more thorough inspection, and while the exterior was pristine there were a few glaring issues in the guts: the electrical cables were all in horrible shape, the motor was somewhat corroded and one of its wires had broken, and whole interior compartment needed a pretty thorough cleaning. But after that a lot of life happened and I wouldn't really start working on this refurbishment project until a few years later.
