		<h2>Welcome stranger!</h2>
	
		<p>My name's <a href="https://www.henry-boyd.com/">Henry</a>, I built this website as a home for the various devices, doohickeys, and thingamabobs I have been/will be tinkering with over the years. I like taking things apart to see what makes them tick and playing around with fun or useful gadgets, not to mention letting my imagination run wild when it comes to ideas about what technology the future might hold. So suffice to say the projects you'll see here will be some combination of physical designs, software, and restoration work.</p>
	
		<p>Part of life is about finding your rhythm. Bebop is about tempo, change, and improvisation. Or at least that's the plan? Don't hesitate to reach out if you want to talk shop or anything!  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA4P1A3jtu0">I'll play myself out</a></p>
